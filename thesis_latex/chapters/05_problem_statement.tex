\chapter{Problem statement}

In this section the main notations, definitions and all auxiliary facts should be introduced.

The overall purpose of the study should be clearly stated here formally.
It is what you hope to achieve in the project - it should be clearly and concisely defined.

Math formulas can be written like $f(x) = x^2$ or inline
\begin{equation}
    f(x) = x^2
    \label{eq::quad_func}
\end{equation}
or inline without numbering
\begin{equation*}
    f(x) = x^2.
\end{equation*}
The reference to the formula can be written as "In~\eqref{eq::quad_func}".

If you need multiple lines formula, \texttt{split} environment can help
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
        & x = 0,\\
        & x = 10.
    \end{split}
\end{equation*}

If you need to describe some cases, then
\begin{equation*}
    f(x) = 
    \begin{cases}
      x^2, & x \leq 0,\\
      x, & x > 0.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation*}

\begin{Def}
  Here is the definition.
\end{Def}

\begin{Th}
  Here is the claim of theorem.
\end{Th}

\begin{Lem}
  Here is the claim of lemma.
\end{Lem}
