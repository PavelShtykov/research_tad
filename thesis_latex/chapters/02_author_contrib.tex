\chapter{Author contribution}

The author of this thesis has made several contributions to the research presented:

The conceptual framework of viewing transformer operations as movement through embedding space was developed by the author, building upon existing literature on transformer architecture and interpretation. This perspective emerged from critical analysis of current approaches that separate token embeddings from hidden states.

The author designed and implemented the analytical methods used to evaluate this interpretative framework, including the similarity metrics between final hidden states and token embeddings, and the visualization techniques for tracking hidden state norms across layers.

The experimental work, including the analysis of pre-trained models and the training of models with specific architectural variations, was conducted by the author. This involved implementing the proposed regularization approach that constrains intermediate hidden states to remain within the token embedding manifold.
